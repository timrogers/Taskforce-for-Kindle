Taskforce for Kindle
====================

A client for the email-integrated task management application, [Taskforce](http://www.taskforceapp.com) built for Amazon Kindle devices using the [Taskforce PHP API library](https://github.com/timrogers/taskforce-php), created also by myself. 

Enjoy taking a look at the source of this, and I hope you find it useful for working on your own applications. If you have any ideas or make any changes, feel free to contact me at tim [at] taskforceapp.com or make a pull request.
